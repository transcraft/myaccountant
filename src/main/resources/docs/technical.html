  <h1>Technical information</h1>
  <p>Transcraft My Accountant was written using the Java language from
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun
  Microsystems</a><sup>®</sup>. The Graphical
  User Interface (GUI) component was developed using the Standard Widget Toolkit
  (SWT) from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a><sup>®</sup>. SWT is the
  foundation layer for the Eclipse project, which provides excellent development
  environment for Java, Perl, and Palm OS<sup>®</sup>, namely in the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> IDE. The underlying
  database technology is the object database technology from
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.db4o.com/">db4objects</a><sup>®</sup>. Reporting technology powered by
  the <a target="_blank" href="http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/">Jasper Reports</a>
  reporting engine. Please follow the above URL's to find out more about these
  technologies.<p>The application has been developed on a Windows<sup>®</sup> platform,
  but has been recompiled and works flawlessly on Linux. Below are the
  screenshots for the same entry account on Linux and Windows (apologies I do
  not yet own an Apple<sup>®</sup> machine to produce the Mac OS X<sup>®</sup> version, but hopefully
  that will be remedied soon).<p>Windows:<p>

  Linux<p><a target="_blank" href="screenshots/ss1l.png">
  <img border="0" src="screenshots/ss1l_s.jpg" width="100" height="53"></a><p>
  The technology from <a href="http://www.db4o.com/">dbobjects</a><sup>®</sup> has
  dramatically shortened the development time, as mapping from domain models to
  persistence is now one single step instead of three. The company also provides
  excellent technical support, with their own developer community program and
  dedicated NNTP server and news groups.<p>
  I used the Visual designer for Jasper Reports from a product called
  <a target="_blank" href="http://ireport.sourceforge.net/">IReports</a>.
  Without this tool, it would have taken much longer to put together the
  templates for the reports. The only down side to IReports is it was written in
  Swing, so the look and feel is a world apart from the SWT based environment
  provided by Eclipse.<p>
  The source code is now available on
  <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>,
  together with the binary distribution for Linux and Win32 platforms. Build and installation is pretty simple, as you can just drop the
  project directly into the Eclipse IDE. Please note that the I used Eclipse 3.0 
  to build the Win32 version, and Eclipse version 3.1 to build the Linux 
  version, so the code should work fine with either (although you might need to 
  tweak the build and runtime paths a bit to pick up the correct SWT Java and 
  native libraries. Drop me a mail if you need help).<h1>
  Outstanding work</h1>
  <p>
  I intend to implement additional features for this application. The features I 
  have in mind are:<ul>
    <li><b>payroll</b> support (this costs me £100 per year currently)</li>
    <li><b>inventory</b> control (I don't need this right now as I only do 
    consultancy work, but if I ever open an Internet shop, this will be top of 
    the list)</li>
    <li>Ecommerce internet front end to link to inventory, with full order 
    management</li>
    <li>customisable Point of Sale terminals (so you can adapt it for your 
    business, be it a Restaurant or a Boutique), this way you don't have to even 
    worry about the accounting back end</li>
    <li>import/export to Sage, QuickBooks, etc.</li>
    <li>on line tax filing (this saves you £250 a year)</li>
    <li>multi-currency support (currently the application is locale aware i.e. 
    it will pick up your local currency/date settings etc. correctly, but you 
    can not pay or receive amounts in another currency)</li>
    <li>integration of Customer Relationship Management and Google Map</li>
    <li>auto web update (for new features, new payroll tables, patches, support, 
    registration etc.)</li>
    <li>context sensitive help</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
  As I have limited resources and free time these days, I would like to get some 
  kind of feedback as to what the level of interest is so I can decide which 
  features to give more priority to, or whether to implement them at all. Let me 
  know either directly by
  <a href="mailto:bookeeper@transcraft.co.uk?subject=Feature Request">email</a> 
  or using the Sourceforge
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=152916&atid=785838">forum</a>. 
  Also, it would be nice to get some feedback and bug reports on the existing 
  application too. I would like to make it better, so if you could be specific 
  about the problems you encountered, rather than just 'it does not work !'.<p>
  <b>NOTE</b>: although most of the things I list above are very UK centric, I 
  have taken care to ensure the application can be configured to run in another 
  country. You will of course have to modify the tax rates etc. for your region 
  to make sure all the ledger postings are done correctly.<h1>
  AOB (Any other Business)</h1>
    <p>
  Other minor tasks are:<ul>
      <li>complete migration to Eclipse 3.1</li>
      <li>Migration to JDK 1.5</li>
      <li>maybe add support for smart PDAs and phones</li>
      <li>finish the Online Manual</li>
      </ul>
