  <a name='pagetop'></a><h1>Entry Accounts
  <img border="0" src="images/icons/account.gif" width="16" height="16"></h1>
  <p>The Book Explorer shows a number of Entry accounts, or if none is shown, 
  you simply click on the Entry account node with your right mouse button to 
  bring up the menu, then select the &quot;Insert...&quot; button
  <img border="0" src="images/ea1.png" width="228" height="60">to create a new 
  entry account. This is typically a current account, or a savings account you 
  have with your bank, although you can also create an Entry account without an 
  external account, like one which lists all your expenses etc. Click on this 
  icon <a target="_blank" href="images/account1.png">
  <img border="0" src="images/account1_s.jpg" width="100" height="115"></a> to 
  see the entry screen for an Entry account. Note that you can enter your 
  opening balance, and the date this balance is relevant for. It is important to 
  note that running balance shown in the transactions section below will take 
  into account this date, so you should make sure it is earlier than the first 
  entry in the list of transactions, unless you know for sure this is the 
  balance for that date from the statement of your bank account. The blue title 
  at the top of your transaction list will display the opening balance and the 
  date this balance is relevant for, as a reminder that you should take this 
  into account when looking at the running balances for the transactions.</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/account2.png" width="971" height="198"></p>
  <h5><b>Transaction Editor</b></h5>
  <p>You can call up the editor for the row you select be either double clicking
  on it or by pressing CONTROL+E. The editor should superimpose exactly on the
  fields for that entry. The following columns can be entered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Invoice Date: the date the entry is recorded into your account. Note that this
    date is different from the transaction (effective) date, which is the date the money
    actually leaves or enters your account. You should use this column to put in
    the date you put in your cheque, or the date when you actually withdraw
    money from your bank account, even though this is not the date shown in your
    bank statement</li>
    <li>Transaction Date: the date in which the transaction is actually effective.
    This date should be used to reconcile against your bank statement</li>
    <li>Reference: free format field to denote a reference, say an invoice
    number, a cheque number, or other free format text of your choice</li>
    <li>Description: the description of the transaction. This field is used in
    reports and should be used to identify the transaction visually</li>
    <li>Account: use this field if you are transferring the amount between your
    accounts. These internal transfers can be excluded from the business reports
    for reporting purposes</li>
    <li>Debit: put the amount into this column if the amount is a payment</li>
    <li>Credit: put the amount into this column if the amount is a deposit or
    income</li>
    <li>Balance: this field is automatically calculated as the running balance
    and is not editable</li>
    <li>Allocation popup: popup up the Allocator to specify the ledger postings
    you want to make. The Allocator has a dropdown of the pre-configured
    Allocation Rules you can use to send percentages of your total amount into
    different ledger accounts. This facility is useful if you are entering tax
    related transactions</li>
  </ul>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/dataentry.png" width="779" height="191"></p>
  <p>Popup Calendars can be shown for the first two date columns by clicking on
  the calendar icons on the entry editor, or by using the key bindings
  CONTROL+DOWN ARROW.</p>
  <p>The Reference and Description fields have associated with them pop ups of
  memorised entries which have been entered before. Also, when you tab out of
  the description field, the application will attempt to fill in the amount the
  the Allocations automatically from the last entry of the same description.
  These features are designed to aid speedy data entry.</p>
  <a name='allocator'></a><h5>Allocator Popup</h5>
  <p>The Allocator can be brought up by either clicking on the allocation button
  in the last column of the entry editor above, or you can use ALT+L key
  binding. The Allocator shows a number of empty rows, each of which will
  represent a percentage of your total amount, and the Ledger Account that
  percentage will be debited or credited against. Built in Allocation Rules
  should make it easy for you to enter tax related entries</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/allocator.png" width="564" height="214"><p>The
  first column controls the Ledger account the row will affect. Ledger accounts
  do not have to be pre-created, as you can type in a new name and the ledger
  will be created automatically. However, you will have to right click on the
  Ledger Account subsequently and select Edit...
  <img border="0" src="images/account_edit.png" width="155" height="83"> in
  order to specify whether that Ledger Account falls into the category Income,
  Expense, Asset or VAT
  <img border="0" src="images/ledger_cat.png" width="268" height="108">. The
  categories are used for reporting purposes.<p>&nbsp;</td>
