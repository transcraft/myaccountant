  <h1>Reports
  <img border="0" src="images/icons/report.gif" width="16" height="16"></h1>
  <p>A number of built in reports are already created for typical monthly, 
  quarterly, or annually reporting. Some reports have fixed rules which can not 
  be changed, others have modifiable criteria to allow grouping of relevant 
  transactions. You should consider using the <a href="adhoc.html">ad hoc 
  reporting</a> feature also if it is your intention to simply search for and 
  group together some specific transactions with common attributes. All the 
  reports can be customised to your specific criteria, then saved as a custom 
  report, so next time you do not have to go through the filtering process 
  again.<p><b>Activity report</b><p>This report has three sections to show the 
  input, output, and break down into categories (or ledgers) of all the 
  transactions listed in the input/output sections. This report excludes all 
  inter-account transfers, accounts which are not tax tracked, and transactions 
  which have no ledger postings.<p><b>Detailed VAT and VAT Summary reports</b><p>
  These two reports are for Value Added Tax reporting purposes in the UK, 
  although you can obviously use them for other countries. You will need to 
  change the tax bands in the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> section 
  accordingly. Only entries which result in a posting to the VAT ledger account 
  are included in these reports. A VAT account is an account whose category is 
  set to &quot;VAT&quot;.<img border="0" src="images/reports1.png" width="171" height="160"><img border="0" src="images/reports2.png" width="268" height="98"><p>
  <b>Input/Output report</b><p>This is a generic report which separates the 
  transactions into credits and debits. You can specify a number of filters to 
  return just the transactions of interest. The report can then be saved under a 
  different name into a custom report so you do not have to go through selecting 
  the filters again in the next run.<p><b>Unpaid Invoices</b><p>Hard coded rule 
  to return invoices which do not have an associated transaction in the Entry 
  accounts.<p><b>Unreconciled</b><p>Shows all entries which have not been 
  reconciled. Reconciliation is covered in the <a href="entryaccounts.html">
  Entry account</a> section.<p><b>Monthly Cashflow</b><p>Shows the input, output 
  and net cashflow for each moth of your financial, so you can make comparison 
  on relative performances from one month to the next.<p><b>Performance</b><p>
  This report hopefully gives you an indication on how well your company has 
  performed so far this financial year, together with any entry in the Entry 
  accounts which have not resulted in any ledger posting. You can then address 
  these breaks before sending the report to your accountant.</td>
